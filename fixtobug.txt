So the rebase() calls _rebase() on line 483.
However, in the  _rebase() 2 for loops have been implemented on line 499 and  501. 
This results in a nested for loop . The first for loop one line 499 for (uint y = 0; y < allCollat.length; y++) . 
This loops over the length of all the collateral assets in the contract. 
However , on line 501 a for loop is inserted in the previous for loop for (uint i = 0; i < allStrategies.length; i++)  .  
This for loop on line 501 goes through all the strategies and calculates if they’ve made a profit and withdraws from the  strategies if they have made a profit . However , the  critical  issue here is that the amount of  strategies has to be equal or less than the amount collaterals in the contract .
Say for instance allCollat.length = 5 and   allStrategies.length= 7 . 
This means that once is on 5th index  a‘ allCollat[4;]’ the for loop ends and therefore the rest of the strategies will not be computed .
